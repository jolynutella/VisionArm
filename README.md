# Project Title: VisionArm

# Description:
This is a diploma project that aims to develop a robotic arm with computer vision capabilities. The project is developed using Flask and Python, as well as Raspberry PI hardware.

The main objective of the project is to design a robotic arm that can perform tasks with increased precision and efficiency by utilizing computer vision. The robot arm will be equipped with cameras and image processing algorithms that allow it to detect and identify objects in its environment. This information will be used to control the movements of the robotic arm, allowing it to interact with the objects and perform specific tasks.

The project is implemented using Flask and Python frameworks, which provide a flexible and modular architecture for building web applications. Raspberry PI hardware is used as the platform for controlling the robotic arm and processing the image data.

# Features:
